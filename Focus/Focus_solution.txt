Author         : Game0v3r

Ideology : Wanted to create a simple binary challenge and also wanted it to look tricky,so i created the challin python and used pyinstaller to convert it to executable.lame method of converting but it still works.

Solution :

The challenge will be provided with an zip file,Unzipping will result in multiple executables,instead of giving a single executable.
As the Description highlights "Focus on the Key for Success",there will be a executable named key and thats the executable contains the flag.

┌─[root@kali]─[~/Desktop/myctf/Focus/test]
└──╼ #./key
jsjs
4
bytecon{%s%d%c}

Running the file will prompted with input,if we enter "jsjs" we resulted with 4 (the length of the input) and a string bytecon{%s%d%c}.

As the end of description says Hit them Hard,We know what we need to do.We need to try inputing larger length inputs.



┌─[root@kali]─[~/Desktop/myctf/Focus/test]
└──╼ #python -c "print('a'*1234)" | ./key
1234
Flag Is bytecon{h1T_m3_Hard3r}

printing a string with length of more than 1000 chars will result in the flag.

Flag : bytecon{h1T_m3_Hard3r}
