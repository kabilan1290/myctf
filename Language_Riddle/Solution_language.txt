Solution:

A text file is given with an unknown language and in top theres a base64 encoding value with flag string highlighted in it,
But thats a rabbithole u need decrypt 4 times to find out theres only a useless strings.

Lets find the language written all over the text file,by using google we can find that is an persian language and all it saying was "flag is here".
If we look closely there were other suspicious things " 粘贴隐藏在这里 " and "Jj90hFqZ".

The first one is chinese language,Decoding that says "Paste is here" and we got a string Jj90hFqZ,From trasnlating the chinese language we can findout the other string is pastebin.com/<string>

So requesting https://pastebin.com/Jj90hFqZ,We get the Flag.
