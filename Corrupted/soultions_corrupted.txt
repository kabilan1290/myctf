Ideology : As far as i know,most of the corupted image challs were based on changing the first byte values,I always thought of something different and come up with changing the IHDR chunk.

Solution:

The challenge is pretty simple.we were given with an corupted image.

But this is not an classic corrupted image,where the extension needed to be changed for solving the problem.

We need to do pngcheck to understand whats the problem.

root@kali:~/Desktop/myctf/Corrupted# pngcheck corrupt.png
corrupt.png  first chunk must be IHDR
ERROR: corrupt.png

From the above we found out that the IHDR chunk has the defect.

Using hexedit to check the png,the IHDR chunk was written as DRIH.Changing the value back to IHDR,You will be restore the corrupted image and get the flag.

Flag : bytecon{1_Pref3r_Coff33}
