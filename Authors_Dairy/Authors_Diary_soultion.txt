Ideology : I attended a CTF named nova in our region where i faced the same type of challenge but with completely different cipher.I implemented the methodology with different cipher here.

Solution : 

The Pdf file contains a hand written cipher and the main thing here is no available decoder for the cipher and moreover its an underrated cipher with very few images in the internet.

So how the user going to find the cipher name?
First we need to use the exiftool and we note that
