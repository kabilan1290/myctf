Ideology : Most of the CTfs contains similar methodology of lyrics challenges.This is one such challenge.

Solution:
On viewing the challenge file we can see there ae binaries spread across here and there.
SO we have to extract the binary alone and to do so,we need to Script.

st = """

<Whole text goes here>

"""
for i in st:
    if ord(i)==49 or ord(i) ==48:
        print(i, end="")

The values 48 and 49 represents 0 and 1.

Running the script gives the values of 0 and 1.

If we thought its an binary and its not,As the challenge says this is spoon encoding.

decrypting in https://www.dcode.fr/spoon-language,Will give us the flag.
